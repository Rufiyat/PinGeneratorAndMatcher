# Pin Generator and Matcher
A pin generator and matcher built using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Click the generate pin button to create a random pin. If the pin you entered matches the  randomly generated pin, a success message will be displayed. You can then generate another pin or close.

Notes:
1. Pin must be 4 digits long
2. If length of entered pin is greater than 4 digits, the display area resets the pin and you can enter another 4 digit pin. You don't loose a try for this.
